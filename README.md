cloud-to-butt, xkcd style
=============

An edit of the [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension from [panicsteve](https://github.com/panicsteve) that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt.' This version of the extension not only replaces that phrase, but also substitutes in phrases found in [XKCD comic 1288](http://xkcd.com/1288/).
